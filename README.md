# MyCars
Spring Boot application used for car managment.

Technologies used :
  - Java
  - Spring (Boot,Web,Data)
  - JPA
  - JavaScript,jQuery
  - Materialize as a front-end framework ( + Thymeleaf )
  
  Since I started learning Spring, I have decided to write my own application. 
  I was inspired by Geoffroy Warin book (http://helion.pl/ksiazki/spring-mvc-4-projektowanie-zaawansowanych-aplikacji-www-geoffroy-warin,smvc4p.htm)
  ,which I strongly recommend, because it shows how easy and pleasant developing application using Spring Boot might be.
  
  Please go to Wiki to see how to start working with MyCars application !
